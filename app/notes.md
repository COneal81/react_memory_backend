JS/Rails Order of Operations Guide (BACKEND)
The JavaScript Project repo has a handful of helpful READMEs that outline the requirements for the JS/Rails Project along with project planning tips and a note about what to expect during your review. There is also this JavaScript Rails API Project Setup README that provides a thorough step by step walkthrough to get your project up and running along with some help OOJS refactoring tips. Lastly, we also wanted to outline a suggested flow of execution to aide you in building your project. We put together this "Order of Operations Guide" for organizing and completing your JS/Rails Project. This guide is based on the 4-part project build. All study groups can be found here.

The application we will create during the project build series is a "Syllabus Sharing App" for independent study.

USER STORY: A user should be able to read and create syllabi based on category

Checklist
PART 1: Planning and Building a Rails API
BEFORE YOU CODE

 1. Check project requirements in JavaScript READMEs
 2. Ideate! What do you want to build?
choose a domain you're familiar with!
choose a domain you care about
 3. Wireframing & User Stories
Write down your models, their attributes, and their associations
"As a user, I can ....."
"A user should be able to ....."
What does your app do?
 4. Design your MVP = 'Minimum Viable Product' vs. what are my 'stretch goals'
Stretch goals - bonus features you want but don't need
NOW WE'RE READY FOR PROJECT SET UP

 5. Generate new Rails API using rails new <my_app_name> --database=postgresql --api
(Replace <my_app_name> with the actual name of your project)
 6. Create github repo
 7. Create a new branch for building out models git co -b <branch_name>. example git co -b category_model This way you can always go back to the fresh API.
NOTE: It is best practice to always create a new branch when working on a new feature/edit to your code. Your master branch should only have working code. Debug in a branch, not in master.
NOW WE'RE READY TO CODE (BUT JUST OUR MODELS — NO CONTROLLERS OR SERIALIZERS YET)

NOTE: Remember to VERTICALLY build your MVP! This means building out one model/feature at a time. DO NOT build out all the models and controllers at the same time. This is the easiest way to get lost in your project very early. Read more about this here.

 8. Build your models: rails g model <your_model_name> name example rails g model Category category_name example for model holding the foreign key rails g model Activity category:references will generates an category_id column in the activities table and will modify the activities.rb model to add a belongs_to :category relationship. This improves db query performance time.
(Make sure you capitalize the first letter of the model name!) - Confirm model and migration - Model classes - for the model that has the belongs_to relationship(foreign key), use rails g model Activity category:references will generates an category_id column in the activities table and will modify the activity.rb model to add a belongs_to :category relationship. - Because we're using PostGres we need to delete null: false, so this migration will be successful. - Add seed data for ONLY the model that you are working on. - Migrations - Then run rails db:create && rails db:migrate - run rails db:seed - Associations - Do not declare the relationship just yet. This will cause errors. ***** Important! When using postgres for our database, we need to run rails db:create & rails db:migrate before migrating. See above. Make sure you don't skip that step ***** Now that our model and table is setup, we should be able to create a new note in the console - git add/commit/push - go to github repo, click compare and merge request(green box) - click create pull request - click merge pull request & confirm merge - click delete branch - check that the merge took place correctly. - in terminal, git co master Switch to branch master - in terminal, git pull syncs local environment with github repo (Be careful with git pull because it will override any code on your local) - git branch - shows all of your branches

 9. Test your models and associations in the console
Create some seed data
Adjust migrations as needed
PART 2: Routes, Controllers, Serializers
 1. Routes

Implement specific namespaced routes for a controller for MVP

REMEMBER! We're trying to build vertically.

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      resources :activities, only: [:index, :create]
    end
  end
end
Run rails routes to confirm routes

Visit http://localhost:3000/api/v1/<your_resource_name> to see error

 2. Controllers

In your console run: rails g controller api/v1/<your controller_name> (Make sure you capitalize and the first letter of the controller name and it is plural!)
example. rails g controller api/v1/Categories
Build relevant routes for MVP (ex: index and create)
Visit http://localhost:3000/api/v1/<your_resource_name> to see JSON data
 3. Fast JSON API Serializer

Add gem 'fast_jsonapi' to your Rails project's Gemfile and run bundle install
this gem gives us access to rails g serializer <your_resource_name>
Create Serializer classes
rails g serializer <your_resource_name> capitialized and singular
Example rails g serializer Category
Update Controller Actions
class Api::V1::ActivitiesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    activities = Activity.all
    # render json: activities
    render json: ActivitiesSerializer.new(activity)
  end
end
Adding Attributes
class ActivitySerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :title, :description, :category_id
end
Accessing Associations (Related Objects)
class ActivitySerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :title, :description, :category_id, :category
end
Adding Relationships
To control the attributes displayed in the association view PART 2 notes on adding relationships
 4. TEST: Confirm data at your Rails endpoints! (ex: http://imbored.com/api/v1/activities)

 5. Build out your associated models using this same process. REMEMBER: Focus on building vertically for MVP this means only starting with 2 or 3 models before moving on to the frontend.

PART 3: DOM Manipulation, Events, and Fetch using Rails API
JS MANTRA: When some event happens, I want to make what kind of fetch and then manipulate the DOM in what way? Initial Setup

 1. Create separate directory for frontend. In terminal type cd.. to go back to main terminal - a. mkdir im_bored_frontend - b. cd im_bored_frontend/ - c. code .

 2. Create index.html file, - a. in terminal type touch index.html - b. Go to index.html and input basic html code - c. with script tag connecting your index.js. Ex: <script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script>

 3. Create src folder and in it create index.js, - a. in terminal, type touch index.js (this will create a new file. index.js is what will render the page for us, like an erb file in rails.) - b. console.log("in index.js"), and check for the logged message in your dev tools to confirm the index.html <> index.js connection was established.

 4. Initialize a git repo for frontend repository.

a. name it the same as the backend. ex. im_bored_backend and im_bored_frontend
b. in terminal, git init
c. in terminal, choose 2nd option on github, 1st line (git remote add origin git@github.com:COneal81/im_bored_frontend.git)
d. in terminal, git add .
e. in terminal, git commit -m'Inital setup'
f. in terminal, choose 2nd option on github, 2nd line (git push -u origin master) Connect your API to your frontend!
 4a. in Gemfile, uncomment gem 'rack-cors', run bundle install

a. in config/initializers/cors.rb uncomment the following code and change the orgin to : Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do allow do origins ''
resource '*', headers: :any, methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options, :head] end end

 5. Think about the JS mantra and answer this question: When the DOM Content is Loaded, I want to make a GET fetch and then manipulate the DOM in what way (usually render the data)?

 6. Create DOMContentLoaded event listener and console.log("loaded") as the event handler to confirm we've properly set up the listener.

 7. We're eventually going to make a call to the index route of our API (ex: localhost:3000/api/v1/syllabuses). Run your rails server and visit that end point in the browser to confirm the expected JSON data is present.

 8. We can see the JSON data in the browser but in order to access it in our frontend, we'll need to setup Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). In order to do this we'll need to do a couple things: Navigate to your Gemfile and uncomment gem 'rack-cors' then bundle install. You can read more about CORS in the PART 3 notes and here.

 9. Commit and push this code! Receive (GET) data from the server

 10. GET request Create a new branch for GET implementation. Create your get____ function (ex: function getToys()) that will make a call to your index endPoint in your API, make your GET request inside the function and console.log the json data, then call your get___ function in the DOMContentLoaded event listener. Once you have confirmed your GET request is returning the JSON you were expecting, use that data to update the DOM.(see PART 3 notes for example) Once working: Commit and push this code! Then merge branch to master. Submit (POST) data to the server

 11. POST request Create a new branch for POST implementation. Create form Create submit event listener Create submit event handler to handle form data Create post_____ function Manipulate the DOM with "posted" JSON data Once working: Commit and push this code! Then merge branch to master.

 12. git pull on the master branch to get working GET and POST functionality. Refactor to make your code more DRY

 13. Make sure you're not repeating yourself unnecessarily in your code. Ex: Create a render function you can use in both your "read" and "create" functions.

 14. Build out any additional features using the JS Mantra: Event, Fetch, and DOM Manipulation flow as a guide. PART 4: OOJS Refactor

 1. IMPORTANT: Create a separate branch for your OOJS Refactor

 2. Create a JS Class (ex: class Syllabus)

 3. Link to the new JS file in your index.html (ex: <script type="text/javascript" src="src/syllabus.js"></script>)

 4. Create a constructor that pushes all instances of this into an empty array (See part 4 notes for example)

 5. Refactor render functionality by creating a render function in your JS class

 6. For future use, create a static method in your JS class that finds an object based on it's id. (In the PART 4 notes we see how this would be useful for 'update/PATCH' functionality)
